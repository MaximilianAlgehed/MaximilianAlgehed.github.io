I'm a Ph.D. student in the functional programming division at Chalmers in Gothenburg.
My primary interest is in the area of Information Flow Control, where I focus mainly
on language-based security in a functional setting.

## Projects
Below is a somewhat up to date list of projects I've been working on:

* [DCC Encodings](projectsHTML/DCC.html) - Encodings of a Security Calculus

* [QuickSpec](projectsHTML/QuickSpec.html) - Theory Exploration

* [VisPar](projectsHTML/VisPar.html) - Dataflow Visualisation for Teaching 

## Papers
[Here](papers.html) you will find a list of PDF files of published
papers and reports.

## Random Writings
I sometimes find the time to do things just for fun. If I find the time
to write the things I do up (however hastily) I will put them here.

* [Solving SAT in 97 characters](blogpostsHTML/SAT.html)
